                <p class="bodytext"> Welcome to Busy B's Plus! I am your Busy B, Britnie. I am 25 years old and hand-make every piece you see here with my heart and soul. I began crafting as a way to help manage my stress and anxiety. I realized that even though these emotions and thoughts can cloud my mind it doesn't inhibit the ability to create positive and beautiful things. <br> <br> 
                        â€‹
                        I fell in love with making jewelry when I was introduced to Natural Crystal and Stone Wire Wrapping, and from there I started creating all sorts of the accessories you see on this site. 
                         <br> <br> 
                        I'm very thankful to have found a craft that brings my soul peace, and if the things I create can bring happiness into someone else's life, it's a good day.</p>
